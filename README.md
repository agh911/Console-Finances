# Challenge 04 JavaScript Fundamentals: Console Finances

## Description

For this project we were required to use our newly acquired JavaScript knowledge and create a code which will analyse the financial records for a company.

The analysis needed to include the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
    *  Track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
    *  (`Total/Number of months`)
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


## Usage
